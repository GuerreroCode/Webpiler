Future Plans
********************************************************
Since a python script is all this is so far, this is more of a 
proof of concept/tool for myseklf to use. A localhost webapp is in developement.
This will be in ASP.NET, so the language will change to C#, and the first step
is to recreate the app with a gui interface.
